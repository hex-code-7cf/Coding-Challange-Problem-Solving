# Burgers

Chef is fond of burgers and decided to make as many burgers as possible.

Chef has \( A \) patties and \( B \) buns. To make 1 burger, Chef needs 1 patty and 1 bun. Find the maximum number of burgers that Chef can make.

## Input Format
The first line of input will contain an integer \( T \) â€” the number of test cases. The description of \( T \) test cases follows.
Each of the next \( T \) lines contains two space-separated integers \( A \) and \( B \), the number of patties and buns respectively.

## Output Format
For each test case, output the maximum number of burgers that Chef can make.



## Algorithm and logic

    maximum number of burgers == minof(a,b)
