# Masterchef Finals

Chef has been working hard to compete in MasterChef. He is ranked \( X \) out of all contestants. However, only 10 contestants would be selected for the finals.

Check whether Chef made it to the top 10 or not.

## Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer \( T \), denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of one integer \( X \) â€” the current rank of Chef.

## Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, `YES` if Chef made it to the top 10 and `NO` otherwise.

Each character of the output may be printed in either uppercase or lowercase. That is, the strings NO, no, nO, and No will be treated as equivalent.

## Constraints
- \( 1 \leq T \leq 100 \)
- \( 1 \leq X \leq 100 \)

## Sample

### Input
4
15
10
1
50

### Output
NO
YES
YES
NO

### Explanation
- **Test case 1**: Chef's rank is 15 which is greater than 10. Thus, Chef did not make it to the top 10.
- **Test case 2**: Chef's rank is 10 which is equal to 10. Thus, Chef made it to the top 10.
- **Test case 3**: Chef made it to the top 10, as his rank is 1.
- **Test case 4**: Chef did not make it to the top 10 as his rank is 50.

### Logic & Algorithm

if x <= 10 print yes else no
